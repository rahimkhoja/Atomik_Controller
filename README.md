# Atomik Controller README #

# Version 0.8 Alpha

The Atomik Controller manages automated and smart lights. Initially The Atomik Controller will manage Mi-Light brand lights and Remotes, but it will expand to other Atomik and third party smart devices. The goal is to create a drop in replacement for the Mi-Light wifi bridge, that expands the zone and device limitations, while providing a more robust home lighting controller. The Atomik controller currently includes a Web GUI for system management, a Nrf24l01+ 2.4 GHz transceiver for listening and transmitting, Mi-Light RF RGB remote compatibility, a Mi-Light Smartphone server emulator that allows use of the Mi-Light Smartphone app as a remote, an API for 3rd party integration, and a task scheduling system to control light zones. 

Hopefully in the future the Atomik Controller will add blue tooth connectivity, additional devices from a variety of manufacturers, Zigbee compatibility, Z-Wave compatibility, OpenHAB compatibility, a simple light io scripting interface, a fully documented API for 3rd party compatibility, and other types of devices and sensors.

### Atomik API Details ###

The Atomik API accepts JSON Commands on Port 4200 of the Atomik Controller to control the Atomik lighting Zones. Atomik API Remotes are setup, and applied to Zones from within the Atomik Controller web administration GUI. Atomik Api Remotes only have two types of commands, List and Issue. List will accept JSON that contains a valid username and password and return a JSON list of all the available zones and their current settings to the user. Issue will accept JSON that contains a valid username and password along with zone light settings, then it will update the light settings and return a JSON list of all the available zones along with the updates zone information from the Issued command. If command is not accepted or invalid credentials are passed to the Atomik API, an error JSON is returned.

All Commands are posted to 'http://192.168.1.100:4200/atomik' ( or the IP Address of the controller )

 Here are some example commands: 



  **List Command - JSON Request Example:** 

    {"Command":"List","User":"rahimk","Password":"password"}




  **List Command - JSON Response:**

    {
     { "ZoneName":"Bedroom", "Configuration":{ "Channel":"0", "Status":"1", "ColorMode":"0", "Brightness":"100", "Color":"198", "WhiteTemp":"2700" }}
     { "ZoneName":"Living Room", "Configuration":{ "Channel":"1", "Status":"1", "ColorMode":"1", "Brightness":"100", "Color":"0", "WhiteTemp":"2700" }}
     { "ZoneName":"Hallway", "Configuration":{ "Channel":"2", "Status":"0", "ColorMode":"1", "Brightness":"100", "Color":"0", "WhiteTemp":"6500" }}
    }




  **Issue Command - JSON Request Example:** 

    {"Command":"Issue","User":"rahimk","Password":"password","Configuration":{"Channel":"1","Status":"1","Brightness":"65","ColorMode":"1","Color":"215","WhiteTemp":"6500"}}




  **Issue Command - JSON Response:**

    {
     {"ZoneName":"Bedroom", "Configuration":{"Channel":"0", "Status":"1", "ColorMode":"0", "Brightness":"96", "Color":"221", "WhiteTemp":"6500"}}
     {"ZoneName":"Living Room", "Configuration":{"Channel":"1", "Status":"1", "ColorMode":"1", "Brightness":"68", "Color":"215", "WhiteTemp":"6500"}}
     {"ZoneName":"Hallway", "Configuration":{"Channel":"2", "Status":"1", "ColorMode":"1", "Brightness":"18", "Color":"215", "WhiteTemp":"6500"}}
    }




  **Invalid Request - JSON Error Response Example:**
  
    {"Error": "Invalid Username or Password"}




  **Notes on Atomik JSON Requests and Response:**

   * Channel can be any integer, but it is assigned by the controller. Each Atomik API will have a channel associated to a Zone.
   * User is the Atomik Username of the Atomik Remote.
   * Password is the Atomik User's password of the Atomik Remote.
   * Status can be 0 or 1. 0 represents Zone lights Off, and 1 represents Zone lights On.
   * ColorMode can be 0 or 1. 0 represents Color Mode, and 1 represents White Mode.
   * Brightness can be any integer between 0 and 100. Brightness represents the percentage of Brightness a Zone is set to.
   * Color can be any integer between 0 and 255. Each Color integer represents a different color while in Color Mode.
   * WhiteTemp can be any integer between 2700 ( Warm White ) and 6500 ( Cold White ). 
   



  **Testing the API with cURL:**

  *curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"Command":"Issue","User":"rahimk","Password":"password","Configuration":{"Channel":"2","Status":"1","Brightness":"10","ColorMode":"1","Color":"215","WhiteTemp":"6500"}}' http://192.168.1.100:4200/atomik*




  *curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"Command":"List","User":"rahimk","Password":"password"}' http://192.168.1.100:4200/atomik*

### Notes ###

 * The code is rather messy and inefficient ( sorry ). With some polishing it should easily become efficient. 
 * Comments have not been added yet. This is still a work in progress.
 * If the Atomik Transceiver is reprogrammed to use two Nrf24l01+ Radio Modules it would greatly improve responsiveness.

## Support

Since I am extremely lazy I am not going to offer any support. Well maybe every once-n-a while. It really depends on my mood. 

That being said, time was spent documenting each command in the scripts. This should allow the scripts to be easily understood and modified if needed.
